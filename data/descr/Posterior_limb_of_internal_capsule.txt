<h4>Posterior Limb of Internal Capsule</h4></hr>
The posterior limb of internal capsule (or occipital part) is the portion of the internal capsule posterior to the genu. The anterior two-thirds of the occipital part of the internal capsule contains fibers of the corticospinal tract, which come from the motor area of the cerebral cortex and, passing downward through the middle three-fifths of the base of the cerebral peduncle, are continued into the pyramids of the medulla oblongata. The posterior third of the occipital part contains sensory fibers, largely derived from the thalamus, though some may be continued upward from the medial lemniscus, the fibers of optic radiation, from the lower visual centers to the cortex of the occipital lobe; acoustic fibers, from the lateral lemniscus to the temporal lobe
fibers that pass from the occipital and temporal lobes to the pontine nuclei</hr>
