<h4>a2009s - Destrieux Atlas</h4></hr>
FSL software developed to automatically identify sulco-gyral structures of the human brain. First, a computer-assisted hand parcellation classified each vertex as sulcal or gyral, and these were then subparcellated into 74 labels per hemisphere. Twelve datasets were used to develop rules and algorithms that produced labels consistent with anatomical rules as well as automated computational parcellation. The final parcellation was used to build an atlas for automatically labeling the whole cerebral cortex. </hr>
