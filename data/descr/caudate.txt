<h4>Caudate</h4></hr>
One of the structures that make up the dorsal striatum, a component of the basal ganglia. The caudate nucleus has been associated with motor processes due to its role in Parkinson's disease, it also plays important roles in various other nonmotor functions as well, including procedural learning, associative learning and inhibitory control of action, among other functions. The caudate is also one of the brain structures which compose the reward system and functions as part of the cortico–basal ganglia–thalamic loop.[1]</hr>
